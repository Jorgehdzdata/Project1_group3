# Project Description  
•	We plan on analyzing 2019's crime data versus 2009's crime data in Illinois to find trends in the data related to crimes committed in Illinois in the past 10 years.  Through this analysis we hope to find either some sort of pattern or significance in the data that would allow us to come up with a list of criteria in which Illinois crime is most common, and to see if it crime has decreased in the past ten years.  These findings will allow us to gain a better understanding of who, when, and what the overall trends in these crimes are.
