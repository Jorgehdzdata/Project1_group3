# •	Project description/outline
•	We plan on analyzing a single year’s crime data in Illinois to find trends in the data related to crimes committed in Illinois. Through this analysis we hope to find either some sort of pattern or significance in the data that would allow us to come up with a list of criteria in which Illinois crime is most common. These findings will allow us to gain a better understanding of who, when, and what the overall trends in these crimes are. 
•	Research questions to answer 
•	What is the gender disparity in terms of crimes committed by those under 25 years old?
•	Are non-residents more likely to commit crimes?
•	What month does the most criminal activity occur?
•	How does the number of crimes per month compare to ten years ago?
•	In winter (Nov-Feb), are violent or non violent crimes more prevalent?
# •	Datasets to be used
•	FBI
